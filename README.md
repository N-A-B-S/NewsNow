# NewsNow Technical Task Submission (Interview Tasks)

This repository encompasses all the work I have performed for the NewsNow Technical Exercise. This repo includes my attempts at providing solutions to the two questions laid out in the PDF sent on the 15/12/2023.

1. Flock of Sheep. 2 hours to complete the question. The word document in the repo includes my written description of the kind of algorithm I would create to attempt to determine the groups of sheep in a field, as well as discussing advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution. No pseudocode or code was written.
2. Search Tree. 2 hours to complete the question. The src code in the repo is the Java code written to attempt to create a suitable OOP Binary Search Tree, You will also find my introductory thoughts about Part 2 of that question, but no detail due to time constraints. To make the running of this code easier, I have Dockerised the application. I recommend looking at the code to understand what it is trying to do, and then reviewing the Container logs to see the kinds of output is returns to the user.
