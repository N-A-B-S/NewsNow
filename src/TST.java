public class TST {
    // 3 children nodes. Still a tree
    // Perhaps we extract some class Tree out? Seeing as both a BST and TST will likely have a lot of the same functionality
    // Add, Remove, Contains, check data etc.
    // However, the approach to the methods will be different for 2/3 children so will require more thought
    // Focus on pt.1 to start tho.
    // Really wish I had done more OOP at uni lol.
